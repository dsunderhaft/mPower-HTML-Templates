<p>
    <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong>
</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to review the overall quality of life among health volunteers.</p>
<p>New technologies allow people to record and track their health and symptoms in real time.  This study will monitor individual's health and symptoms using questionnaires via a mobile phone application.</p>
<p>If you decide to join the study you will need to download the study application on your mobile device.  Then periodically we will ask you to answer questions and perform some activities via your mobile phone.  These questions may be about your physical and/or mental health, in addition to other surveys. Your study data will include your responses to surveys.</p>
<p>Your data, without your name, will be added to the data of other study participants and analyzed by the study team. You will have a unique account that you can use to review your own data.  </p>
<p><strong>How long will I be in the research study?</strong><br />
We anticipate this study will last about six weeks, however the app can remain on your phone for multiple years.</p>
<p><strong>How many people will take part in this study?</strong><br />
We anticipate enrolling 100 subjects in the study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PROCEDURES</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>What will you be asked to do?</strong><br />
  If you decide to join the study you will need to download the free study application on your mobile device, <br />
register an account and confirm your agreement to participate in this study.  Then, periodically we will ask you to answer questions on your mobile phone. Your study data will include your responses to surveys and activities and some measurements from the phone itself.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Register to the study:  </strong>You will follow the prompts on the app to register an account and confirm your agreement to participate in this study. There will be an electronic consent process explaining the risks and benefits of using the app. Registration will include entering your name, email address and other general information about yourself to verify your eligibility.  You can cancel the registration process at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Health Surveys</strong>: We will periodically ask you to answer questions about yourself and your current health/symptoms to track changes. You may skip any questions that you do not wish to answer blank.  </li>
    <li><strong>Activities</strong>:  You will only be required to complete surveys for this study. No other study related procedures will be asked of you.  
<p>We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these activities and surveys.  You may choose to act at your convenience, (either then or later) and you may choose to participate in all or only in some parts of the study.  This study should take you about 5 minutes each day.  You can adjust the app settings to turn on and off sending data at any time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    <strong>What we will and will not do with the data?</strong>


<ul>
	<li><strong>Data Processing</strong>: We will electronically process your data and separate your account information (name, email, contact information, etc.) from your study data (your responses to surveys and the measurements from the phone itself when you perform activities). We will combine your coded study data (without your name) with those of other study participants.  The combined data will be transferred electronically to REDCap Cloud (redcapcloud.com), an electronic data capture platform for storage and analysis.</li>
	<li><strong>Use in research</strong>:  The research team will analyze the combined data and report findings back to the community through scientific publications.  Your study data (without your contact information) may also be used by other researchers and for other research purposes if you choose to share Them  more broadly.  The Principal Investigator and Sponsor will have no oversight on the future use of the shared study data.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. However, given this is not a medical study we anticipant risks, discomforts, and inconveniences to be marginal. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is not a treatment study and we do not expect any medical side effects from participating.      </li>
    <li>Some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable. Know that the information you provide is entirely up to you and you are free to skip questions that you do not want to answer.      </li>
    <li>Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone and realize you are enrolled in this study.  This can make some people feel self-conscious.  </li>
    <li>Be safe – just as you would not text while driving, do not fulfill study activities while driving.  Wait until you are in a safe place to perform study-related activities!</li>
    <li>We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of privacy.  This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can <u>directly</u> identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research data to respect your privacy.  However, even with removal of this information, experts in re-identification may be able to reverse our processes and/or attempt to re-identify an individual given enough cross-reference information about him or her.  </li>
    <li>Accidental public disclosure may occur due to unintended data breaches including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study.  In such a case, your data may be misused or used for unauthorized purposes. </li>
  <li>Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use WiFi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan. </li>
    <li>Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time. You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.</li>
    
</ul>



<p>
    <strong>POTENTIAL BENEFITS</strong>
</p>
<p>The goal of this study is to create knowledge, which can benefit us as a society. The benefits are primarily the creation of insights to help current and future patients and their families to better detect, understand and manage their health. We will return the insights learned from analysis of the study data through the study website, blogs and/or research publications, but these insights may not be of direct benefit to you. We cannot, and thus we do not, guarantee or promise that you will personally receive any direct benefits from this study.  However you will be able to track your health and export your data at will to share with your medical doctor and anyone you choose.</p>
<p>
    <strong>PAYMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You will not be paid for being in this study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>COSTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There is no cost to you to participate in this study other than to your mobile data plan if applicable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>ALTERNATIVES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Since no medical treatments are provided during this study there are no alternative therapies. The only alternative is to not participate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>AUTHORIZATION TO USE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES</strong>
</p>
<p>Because information about you and your health is personal and private, it generally cannot be used in a research study without your written authorization.  If you sign this consent form, you will provide that authorization.  You do not have to sign this form.  But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this research study.</p>
<p>
    <strong>What personal information will be used or disclosed?</strong><strong>?</strong> Your personal health information that may be used or disclosed in connection with this research study, may include, but is not limited to your body height, weight, gender, age, ethnicity/race, health history, answers to study questions, and health information that may be discernible from your mobile phone&rsquo;s sensors.  Your account information, study data and signed consent form may also be looked at and/or copied by designated personnel for regulatory and quality assurance. </p>
<p>
    <strong>Who may use and disclose my data? </strong>The study sponsor, investigators, study coordinators and study staff may use and disclose your personal information to do the research described above or as required by law (e.g. to prevent possible injury to yourself or others). </p>
<p>
    <strong>When will my authorization expire?</strong>Your authorization for the use and/or disclosure of your health information will expire if you choose to withdraw from the research study or by December 31, 2060.</p>
<p>If you choose to withdraw from the research study, we will stop collecting your study data.  At the end of the study period we will stop collecting your data, even if the application remains on your phone and you keep using it.  If you were interested in joining another study afterward, we would ask you to complete another consent, like this one, explaining the risks and benefits of the new study.</p>
<p>
    <strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong><br />
We are committed to protect your information and keep your identity as confidential as possible, however total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. Except as required by law, you will not be identified by name or by any other direct personal identifier. The data collected through the app will be encrypted on the smartphone, transferred electronically and stored securely on the Synapse data repository and analysis platform using Amazon-Web Cloud Services.  Your contact information, including your name and e-mail address will be stored separately from the study data.  We will use a random code number instead of your name on all your study data. This code cannot be used to directly identify you. Information about the code will be kept in a secure system.  </p>
<p>We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, text or email message content, or websites visited. WE WILL NEVER SELL, RENT OR LEASE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION.</p>
<p>
    <strong>COMPENSATION FOR INJURY</strong><br />

    THIS STUDY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION, HEALTH OR MEDICAL CARE TO PARTICIPANTS.
</p>
<p>
    If you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, the Principal Investigator or the medical monitor and the research study staff
    will assist you in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. Your medical insurance, managed care plan, or other benefits program will be billed for this
    treatment. You will be responsible for any associated co-payments or deductibles as required by your insurance.
</p>
