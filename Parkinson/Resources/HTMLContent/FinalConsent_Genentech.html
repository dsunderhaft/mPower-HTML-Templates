<p>
    <b>Description of Procedures</b>
</p>
<p>When you agree to participate in this study, the following actions will be taken:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>You will receive an email with a Quick Response or “QR" Code and be asked to download the REDCap Cloud app from the Apple Store.</li>
    <li>You will be asked to set up an account with REDCap Cloud and answer a screening questionnaire.</li>
    <li>You will be asked to review information within the app including a description of this pilot, procedures for maintaining confidentiality, equipment and questionnaires used in this pilot, and any known risks.</li>
	<li>You will be asked to “sign” the informed consent within the app through an e-consent process.</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL:  You will be given the option of synching your step count from Apple Health Kit to the REDCap Cloud app.</li>
    <li>You will be asked to complete two sets of questionnaires inquiring about your perceptions of your general quality of life and health status.  NOTE:  You may skip any questions you feel uncomfortable answering.</li>
    <li>You will be notified via the REDCap Cloud app to complete two questionnaires every week for four (4) weeks , for a total of eight (8) questionnaires.</li>
	</ul>  
<p>
<b>Risks and Discomforts</b>
</p>
<p>There are no anticipated risks or discomforts associated with this study.</p>
<p>
<b>Expected Benefits</b>
</p>
<p>The benefit of participating in this research study may be the satisfaction in helping contribute towards the understanding of health and disease as well as the development of new treatments for disease, however, this cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>
<b>Payment for Participation</b>
</p>
<p>You will be compensated $40.00 for your time to complete all eight (8) questionnaires.  Payments are processed monthly by Payroll and will appear as a line item on your paystub.</p>
<p>
<b>Alternatives</b>
</p>
<p>Your alternative is to not be in this study.</p>
<p>
<b>Confidentiality</b>
</p>
<p>The medical information that you share with Genentech study staff through the study questionnaire and the data collected from the REDCap Cloud app are treated as confidential medical information.</p>
<p>Your name will be replaced with a unique numeric participant ID code to ensure your identity is kept private and the data you submit is not linked to you. The coded data will be encrypted and stored on a secure REDCap Cloud server.  The risk of loss of confidentiality of your data is very low. Only study staff will have access to the key that links your name to your unique participant ID number.</p>
<p>Although the research in this study will be done in a manner that does not identify you, it may be necessary to link the participant code assigned to you back to your data. This process is called “re-identification.”  Your data will only be “re-identified” in order to contact you if an investigator would like to collect additional data from you, if the research results need to be part of the information sent to the FDA or other regulatory agency or if there is discovery of a potential medical issue that would require you to follow up with your personal physician. “Re-identification” will be done in a manner that maintains participant confidentiality.</p>
<p>You will have access to copies of all the data you submit.</p>
<p>
<b>Compensation for Injury</b>
</p>
<p>There is minimal risk associated with this study. There are no plans to provide you with compensation if injury occurs.</p>
<p>
<b>Source of Funding</b>
</p>
<p>Funding for this research study will be provided by Roche/Genentech.</p>
<p>
<b>Voluntary Participation/Withdrawal</b>
</p>
<p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decide not to participate or you may leave the study at any time. If you change your mind, tell a member of the study staff that you no longer want to participate.  You do not need to give a reason for changing your mind.</p> 
<p>
Your decision will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.
</p>
<p>
Your participation in this study may be stopped at any time by the study staff without your consent for any reason.
</p>
