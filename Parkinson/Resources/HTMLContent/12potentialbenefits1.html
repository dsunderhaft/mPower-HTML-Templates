<p>Patient-reported data are essential in clinical trials to capture the treatment benefit directly from the patient. Electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) can offer a more convenient method of administration, through faster completion times, increased data privacy, and data monitoring in real time. As ePRO data become more common, there is a high level interest in the bring your own device (BYOD) method, requiring more investigation in a pilot setting. This research collaboration will test the feasibility and appropriateness of REDCap Cloud for this purpose. REDCap Cloud is an electronic data capture software developed by nPhase for use in the clinical trial setting.
